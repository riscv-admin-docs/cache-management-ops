## Cache Management Ops Charter

The Cache Management Operation, or CMO, task group intends to define data cache
management operations for the RISC-V architecture, providing support for use-cases
such as software-managed cache coherence, power management, persistent storage,
security, and RAS. In the process, a data cache model will be developed, and the
interactions of CMOs with the memory ordering model will be specified. In addition,
the CMO specification will attempt to minimize the requirements on system design
and will not prescribe a specific cache state model or cache coherence protocol.
The CMO TG will coordinate with other RISC-V committees and task groups and with
external parties to ensure consistency and interoperability with respect to any
cache-related features and extensions.

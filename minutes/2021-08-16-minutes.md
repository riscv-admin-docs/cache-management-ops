# Initial Agenda

- Any last comments before submitting the draft specification to the arch review
- Discuss next steps and timelines re: the DoD checklist

# Minutes

- Opened floor for last minute edits
  - Some additional comments will be added in GitHub

- Definition of Done checklist items
  - Reach out to other TGs and TPMs to navigate process
  - Arch tests
    - Same issues as always: finding people to write tests and code SAIL model
    - Similar difficulty as VM TG issues since these (Zicbom and Zicbop) operate largely on microarchitectural structures
    - Do we create an architectural model of caches? (of TLBs as well?); set up TG/SIG to explore options?
  - Proof of concept
    - These operations exist in other architectures (these extensions are bringing parity to RISC-V)
    - The Linux maintainers are asking for an architectural solution for non-coherent I/O
    - Use-cases: mapping to existing, industry standard bus transactions
  - Toolchains
    - Reach out to Philipp (SW HC) for feedback/direction
    - Volunteers?

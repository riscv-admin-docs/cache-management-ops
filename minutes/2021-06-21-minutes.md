# Initial Agenda

- Provisional instruction encodings for Zicbom and Zicboz
- Options for Zicbop
- Mapping of CMOs to AMBA protocol transactions (requested topic)
- Overview of CSRs (and can we pare down some functionality for phase 1?)

# Minutes

- Zicbom/z instruction encodings
  - Discussed encoding email
  - A comment arose regarding the amount of encoding space
    - Most space is reserved for the possible inclusion of features previously discussed

- Zicbop instruction encodings
  - Brief overview of the various constraints
  - Next steps: send proposal to CMO mailing list to discuss

- CMO to AMBA protocol mappings
  - Mapping is straightforward given the architectural similarities
  - Suggestion to describe mappings in platform specification
  - Need to check if OK to include such information in RVI specs

- CSR discussion
  - Call to review current proposal with respect to CBO.INVAL
    - Support for existing proposal and for simplifying proposal

- Misc announcements
  - Goal to ratify three extensions (Zicbom, Zicboz, Zicbop) this year
    - Will reduce features if necessary to reach this goal
  - Repo reorg - no concerns, so will proceed
  - Spec reorg - simplified description for phase 1
    - Portions of existing "structural" description will be moved to non-normative section
    - Zicmobase will be broken up into Zicbom, Zicboz, and Zicbop specs

- Deferred discussion of DoD plan

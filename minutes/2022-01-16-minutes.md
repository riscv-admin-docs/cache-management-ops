# Minutes (2022-01-16)

- Discussed bullets sent to email list (copied here)
  - Fully specify behavior in the context of mismatched attributes and changing attributes/permissions (via PTEs, PMAs, or PMPs) - this will require working with the priv spec, VM TG, etc.
  - Fully specify behavior in the context of instruction fetches - this will require working with the J-ext TG
  - Figure out something for the "large buffer" problem, i.e. you have a large buffer (>> cache size) so you don't want to walk over the entire buffer cache line by cache line; this could be an "all" instruction or a series of index instructions?
  - Mixed cache block/line sizes (note that I purposely chose "block" to be a software concept, reserving "line" as an implementation concept, so there are a couple of different routes we can take here)
  - Completion semantics  - ties in with memory model

- Question was raised whether completion could be described in context of current architecture
  - Possibly add non-normative comment to describe how implementations can implement FENCE with completion semantics instead of ordering semantics
  - Also relevant to to persistent storage use-cases

- Discussion on finishing phase 1 tasks vs. introducing phase 2 features
  - Updates to Spike for v1.0 here: https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-isa-sim/pull/891
  - Other ecosystem work (arch tests, toolchains, etc.) in progress as well

- Add persistence to phase 2 tasks?

- Prioritize behavior in context of mismatched attributes, changing attributes, and instruction fetches
  - Request to prioritize handling large buffers

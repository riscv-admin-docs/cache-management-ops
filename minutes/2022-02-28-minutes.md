# Minutes (2022-02-28)

- Defined the "large buffer" problem
  - Simple problem statement: How to manage buffers that are much larger than the caches?
  - Agreed to adopt current CBO semantics and use-cases for non-coherent I/O or other agents

- Philosophical viewpoints:
  - Need an Architecture solution, i.e. a definition that spans multiple implementations and does not constrain possible microarchitectures
  - Implementation of solution can use trap and emulate as an escape valve

- Baseline implementation of large buffer operation: SW loop over buffer with existing CBO instructions; what can be done better?
  - Performance limiter is due to global operations across the entire cache hierarchy
  - "Standard" bus protocols not really designed to handle larger units than a cache block; anything larger requires custom implementation
  - Contiguous buffer in VA space or Guest PA space is not necessarily contiguous in PA space, so there is a practical upper bound that can be transmitted based on translation

- What about portability (instead of performance)?
  - There is a desire for portability, but how?
  - Portable via ISA or software calls, i.e. SBI?

(more to come...)
